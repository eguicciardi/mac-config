# mac-config

This is the script I usually launch setting up a new machine. Lately I choose to exclude from backups executables and applications so bootstrapping a new machine quickly is essential for having as little downtime as possible.

The script is heavily based on the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager and at the end it sets some very opinionated defaults in MacOS.
